- Gradle uses BFS to build the classpath, this means that the attack is still possible but you can only target libraries that are on the same level (or deeper) on the right side of the tree.
- Also, while using gradle, dependencies cannot add other repositories for their dependencies, so the malicious code is even harder to hide.
